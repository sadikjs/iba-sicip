                The economy of Bangladesh is growing steadily benefiting from reforms
                 and increasing openness. Annual GDP growth has accelerated from 4.1% 
                 
                 in the period FY1973-1978 to 6.2% in FY2008-2013. Excitingly, 
                 since FY 2015-16 Bangladesh has been experiencing more than 
                 7.0% GDP growth which crossed 8.0% in 2018-19 that gives the country
                  an aspiration to claim up to double digits. Literacy rate has increased 
                  over past decades, so has school enrollment, and particularly girls and women&rsquo;s
                   participation in education. Population and labor force is predominantly young with more
                    than a third in the 15-34 age group in 2010. Bangladesh is well-placed to 
                    benefit from the demographic dividend up to 2050 and perhaps beyond due to 
                    decline in fertility rates which, combined with effective policies and markets, 
                    triggers faster rates of economic growth and human development.

                This may be reinforced by the growth of labor productivity 
                through skills development and technological progress especially
                 Information and Communication Technology (ICT) driven move towards
                  a knowledge economy. However, skill is recognized after infrastructure 
                  and energy as the prime factor to industrial growth, productivity,
                   export diversification and producing high value products. It needs to 
                   be mentioned here that the Asian Development Bank&rsquo;s (ADB) Bangladesh 
                   Country Partnership Strategy (for 2012 to 2016) identifies the low competitiveness
                    of firms as a key constraint to growth particularly the low skills and
                     low productivity of the workforce.
