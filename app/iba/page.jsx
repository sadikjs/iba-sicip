                feel honoured to be appointed the Director (Acting) of the Institute
                 of Business Administration (IBA), University of Dhaka. 
                 I assume my role seeking to add value and make a difference, 
                 and committing to act with integrity to achieve positive
                  outcomes for the Institute and its stakeholders. I earnestly 
                  seek Guidance from my Creator and Sustainer Allaah SWT 
                  in performing my duties and responsibilities honourably and righteously.

                Throughout my journey with IBA first as a student,
                 and then, as a faculty member I have experienced and
                  witnessed how our Institute delivers for its students 
                  a strong return on investment. Our students have made us
                   proud both at home and abroad. They are living proof of 
                   how the Institute&rsquo;s experiential learning style develops 
                   transferable skills of students (and trainees) making them more 
                   competitive in the job market. IBA builds their confidence to 
                   become strategic thinkers and agents of social as well as economic changes.

                Our goal is to foster a culture of continuous improvement
                 that ensures we operate effectively in an ever-widening ecosystem.
                  It is critical that IBA is innovative in producing responsible
                   leaders through prioritizing ethical practices, social justice, 
                   cross-cultural perspectives, inclusion, entrepreneurship and
                    sustainability by embedding these not only in the curriculum but 
                    also by setting examples through how we lead and govern the Institute.

                We remain resolute about strengthening cooperation 
                and collaboration with business, industry, universities and research 
                organizations at home and overseas, and preserving excellent
                 relationship with our alumni. I am excited at the opportunities
                  we can create together to energize the Institute and deliver 
                  on our promise of a better tomorrow for our country, its people 
                  and the world at large.

                I take this opportunity to express my deep appreciation to my 
                colleagues - both former and current - at IBA for their role in
                 taking the Institute to even greater heights. I acknowledge the 
                 contributions of the staff and employees of IBA who help to
                  ensure the smooth functioning of our great Institute. 
                  I would also like to thank the countless organizations,
                   businesses and our valued alumni who have been working 
                   with us in enriching the learning experiences and growth 
                   opportunities for our students. I also solicit cooperation 
                   from all my esteemed colleagues and our stakeholders in our
                    journey in leading the Institute in an evolving local and global environment.
